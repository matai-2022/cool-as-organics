## Progress log

### Wednesday 13 July 2022
We completed most of the planning and during the discussion considered a pivot towards a more B2B product that operated on a larger scale and without the consumer-oriented features like recipe suggestion. However, after talking through the concept decided that it was going to be too big in scope and decided to stick with original concept.
